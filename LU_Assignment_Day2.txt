Q1) What is the time, space complexity of following code:
	int a = 0, b = 0;
	for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
	a = a + 1;
	}
	for (j = 0; j < M; j++) {
	b = b + j;
	}
	
Answer: Time Complexity is O(N+M) as there are two separate loops.
	Space Complexity is O(1) as a and b are global variables and no local variables are created inside each loop.
		
		
Q2) What does it mean when we say that an algorithm X is asymptotically more efficient than Y?
	a)X will be a better choice for all inputs
	b)X will be a better choice for all inputs except possibly small inputs
	c)X will be a better choice for all inputs except possibly large inputs
	d)Y will be a better choice for small inputs
	
Answer: Option (b) is correct.
	Asymptotically efficient means that particular algorithms will work in a better way than the other one for some input N where N > N0 > 0.
